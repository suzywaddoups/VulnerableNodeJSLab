# VulnerableNodeJSLab
The purpose of this NodeJS web application is to help you gain experience modifying source code to harden a website against some of the most common web vulnerabilities.  The python grading script should be used to check that the web app was appropriately fixed.


We have created a vulnerable VM that contains the vulnerable NodeJS application.  The packaged vulnerable web application VM can be downloaded using the following link:

Contained on the vulnerable VM is a copy of this vulnerable NodeJS web application.  The vulnerable web application contains three pages: a homepage, a page susceptible to SQL injection (SQLi), and a page susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS).
